NAME
    WWW::Search::Bookmarks - Search a Bookmarks server via XMLRPC

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Search;
      my $search = WWW::Search->new(
        'Bookmarks',
        server => 'http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/'
      );
      $search->native_query('world of warcraft linux');
      while (my $result = $search->next_result() ) {
        print $result->url, "\n";
        print $result->description, "\n";
        print join(' - ', @{$result->{tags}})."\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an Bookmarks specialization of WWW::Search. It handles
    searching a Bookmarks server http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/ using its
    XMLRPC interface http://bookmarks.socklabs.com/docs/api.

    This class exports no public interface; all interaction should be done
    through WWW::Search objects.

NOTES
    Because the search data is raw xml, this module uses XMLRPC::Lite and
    XML::Simple for the majority of the hard work.

    In addition to returning a WWW::SearchResult object, this package will
    also provide tags as an array of tags associated with a url.

    Please note that searches may possibly return duplicates due to the
    contectual searching of description fields and url tags. Multiple users
    may bookmark and tag a url in similar ways, which could lead to
    confusion in search results.
